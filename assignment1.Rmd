```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code block/chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE)
```


1. Look up the help documentation for the function `rep()`. Use this function to create the following 3 vectors.

a. [1] 0 0 0 0 0

```{r}
rep(0, times = 5)
```

b. [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 4)
```

c. [1] 4 5 5 6 6 6

```{r}
rep(4:6, times = 1:3)
```


2. Load the *mtcars* dataset by using the code `data(mtcars)`.  What are the units of observation? How many unit of observations does this dataset have? How many variables?  Remember that wherever possible, you will need to use R code to answer the questions. The dataset's help documentation `? mtcars` might be useful.

```{r}
#Each unit of observation is a car model
#There are 32 observations and 11 variables in this dataset.
data(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)  # Shows number of observations and variables
```

3. Explain what is the problem in each line of code below. Fix the code so it will run properly. 

a. my variable = 3

```{r}
# underscore needed, variable names cannot have spaces
my_variable <- 3
```

b. seq(1, 10 by = 2)

```{r}
# comma missing, incorrect parameter syntax
seq(1, 10, by = 2)
```

c. Class(c(1,2,3))

```{r}
# class should be lower case
class(c(1, 2, 3))
```
