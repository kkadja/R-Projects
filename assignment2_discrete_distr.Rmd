1. A garage door sales company notes that about 70% of their customers purchase a chaindriven model. Suppose a random sample of 18 customers are selected. What is the probability that:

A. Fifteen of the customers have a chain-driven model?

```{r}
dbinom(x = 15, size = 18, prob = 0.7)
```

B. All of the customers have a chain-driven model?

```{r}
dbinom(x = 18, size = 18, prob = 0.7)
```

C. At most 14 of the customers have a chain-driven model?

```{r}
pbinom(q = 14, size = 18, prob = 0.7)
```


D. More than 12 of the customers have a chain-driven model?

```{r}
1 - pbinom(q = 12, size = 18, prob = 0.7)
```

2. Consider writing to a computer disk and then sending the disk through a certifier that counts the number of missing pulses. Suppose a disk is selected at random and sent through the certifier when, on average, 1.85 pulses are missing per disk. What is the probability that:

A. One pulse is missing?

```{r}
dpois(x = 1, lambda = 1.85)
```

B. More than 3 pulses are missing?

```{r}
1 - ppois(q = 3, lambda = 1.85)
```

C. At most 3 pulses are missing?

```{r}
ppois(q = 3, lambda = 1.85)
```

D. Fewer than 5 pulses are missing?

```{r}
ppois(q = 4, lambda = 1.85)
```
